        * Cod is a low-fat source of protein, making it an excellent choice for people who would like to 
        reduce their fat intake and improve their heart health. Cod also contains a significant amount of iodine, 
        which is an important mineral for thyroid function.<br><br>

    flaky texture. It's firmer than tilapia so preparing it at home is easier if you don't have experience with seafood.</p>
